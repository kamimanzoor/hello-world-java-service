### Instructions

# Conventional Commit Messages

When creating commit messages, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to ensure clarity and consistency. Use the following format for your commit messages:

```<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]``` 

The description must be concise and must be less than 50 characters. It must also be in the imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug" instead of "fixed bug" or "fixes bug").

Always add body and footer sections.
